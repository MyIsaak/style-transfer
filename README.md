# Usage

1. Clone and open in Unity
2. Select an image from the Project menu, and make sure it stays selected
3. On the top navbar, chose a style from the dropdown menu at Window -> Style Transfer

You have now transfered an art style onto the selected image which will be saved in a new copy.

# Limitations
